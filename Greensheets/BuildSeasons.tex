All Court of Element Pixies know how to build Season Units. But weâ€™re all done building units for this go around, right? Right? Any Pixie can help build units, and multiple pixies can collaborate. As long as at least one Element Pixie helps in a meaningful way, no pixie dust is required for the unit (see step 7)

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prepare a vessel for holding each season by folding an Origami Masu Box using origami paper for EACH season (Instructions available at the Court of Elements Table).
	\item All supplies must be called in by various courts. \textit{(OOC Note: This is a kludge to force characters to talk to each other and collaborate.)}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Structure Pixies can call for up to 2 units of paper (origami, construction, tissue, or round white circles) every 30 minutes.
		\item F\&F pixies can call for 1 stamp \& stamp pad, or 10 leaf stickers every 30 minutes.
		\item Each Maker Pixie can call for up to 5 units of pipe cleaners every 30 minutes.
		\item Magic Pixies can call for any quantity of pixie dust at any time, as long as there is supply available in storage.
		\item By the magic of Element pixies, pens, glue, and scissors are freely available.
		\item \textbf{To request supplies: Write the GM a note on a 3x5 card with your character name, the time of the request, and any specifics like what kind of paper, or what color(s) you want. The GM can show you the options, and help you check when you are eligible to make another request.}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item To make 1 unit of Spring: (3 flowers = 1 unit)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Use at least 2 different colors of pipe cleaners to bend into a flower shape.
		\item Please try not to use more than 10 pipe cleaners per flower or we might run out.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item To make 1 unit of Summer: (3 images or 1 scene = 1 unit)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cut or tear small pieces of tissue paper.
		\item Glue to a half piece of construction paper to make a simple image or scene (e.g. A tree, a sun, an umbrella at the beach)
	\end{enumerate}
	\item To make 1 unit of Autumn: (1 collage = 1 unit)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Use stickers, leaf stamps and/or freehand drawing to create a collage of leaves on a half piece of construction paper. Collage must cover at least 80\% of the paper.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item To make 1 unit of Winter: (3 snowflakes = 1 unit)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Fold a round white construction paper circle up like pie slices.
		\item Use scissors to cut shapes out of the folded edges of the paper.
		\item Unfold to reveal the design.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item If the unit was made entirely by NON-Element pixies, 1 unit of pixie dust or solar butterfly energy must also be expended.
	\item \cEHead{} will receive the unit (aka: it is \cEHead{\their} job to keep count) and place the unit in the appropriate box. If \cEHead{} is unavailable, \cSHead{} can do this in \cEHead{\their} stead.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item You may never have more than a 2 unit difference between the season with the most, and the season with the fewest units.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
