This greensheet does not represent a ritual, and therefore cannot be interrupted.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item OPTIONAL: Prepare a way to safely carry \textbf{cold iron} temporarily. (small craft)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Acquire a pipe cleaner, tissue paper, and glue.
		\item Bend the pipe cleaner into a 2-D mitten shape (see image below for a suggestion).
		\item Use the glue to attach the tissue paper across the surface of the mitten shape, filling in the outline.
		\item This mitten (which represents a glove of leaves and mud in game) will protect you from damage by cold iron for 5 minutes of contact (does not need to be continuous). You can always make more mittens.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item You must acquire a piece of cold iron. You can do this at any point while the portal is open (from 15 minutes into game until 5 minutes before the end of game).
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Step through the open Portal to the Human World.
		\item Spend 5 minutes searching for the iron in the nearby world. If someone can tell you where to find the iron (e.g. someone from the away team), it will only take you 2 minutes instead.
		\item You may take a piece of iron from “Sign 1”.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item If you have prepared a protective mitten (step 1) you take no damage until your mitten timer runs out.
			\item If you did NOT prepare the mitten, you may still carry the iron, but it \textbf{hurts} to do so, and once you put the iron down somewhere, you cannot pick it up again, except with the other hand. The hand used to touch the iron cannot be used for \textbf{any} tasks until it is healed by the expenditure of 5 units of pixie dust or solar butterfly energy, or 5 season units. (This can easily happen post game; your character is not permanently harmed by this action.)
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Tape or glue the piece of cold iron to the “Airship Prototype” item to represent installing it in the structure that conducts heat into the balloon portion of the Airship.
\end{enumerate}

That’s it. You’re done. You have a working prototype! Now you just have to convince the Structure Pixies that it is worth building more.
