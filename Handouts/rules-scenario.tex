\section*{Interrupting someone:}
Actions cannot generally be interrupted. A character does a thing, and it happens. The only exception is ``rituals'' (see below). Rituals are a single activity that requires multiple steps. A character can interrupt a ritual by moving close enough that you could reach out and touch the other player. Point at them and say ``I stop you''. No touching required. \textit{(Fun fact: If you know what a ZoC (zone of control) is, this is HALF that distance.)}

\section*{Magic:}
Magic in this game is represented as abilities and greensheets. Expect your abilities to be themed to your character and their Court. The list of abilities you have are not the full extent of magic available to your character, but a subset of the ones we judge most likely to be useful during the game, without breaking the game balance so that the game isnâ€™t fun for anyone else but you.

Some magical abilities will have a number of times they can be used in game, targeting or timing requirements, and/or consume a unit of \textbf{Pixie Dust} to use the ability, or to complete an action item on a greensheet. \textbf{Pixie Dust} is a specific, consumable item that Magic and Maker pixies are the most likely to have on hand.

\subsection*{Rituals:}
Some types of magic take place as rituals. These are usually described in greensheets and involve several steps to complete. You must always answer truthfully if someone asks if you are performing a ritual (it may not be obvious to players, but it is always obvious to characters). Rituals are always interruptible (see above). Some rituals will require you to start over if you are interrupted. Others are just paused. Check your ritual for specifics.

\section*{Combat:}
Violence is quite uncommon among pixies, but sometimes you may need to restrain someone or something, take something away from someone, or in the most extreme cases, knock something unconscious (e.g. a rampaging squirrel).

Combat is a straightforward matter of playing rock-paper-scissors (Please don't game the system; play it straight). Use this mechanic if you encounter a situation that cannot be resolved through IC discussion in which the involved characters agree on a course of action. You may attempt to force your course of action by invoking combat.

\begin{itemize}
	\item To begin, challenge someone to combat. You can only instigate combat with a character you could reach out and touch. Combat can only occur between 2 people. You may always have another player or GM stand in for you if the mechanic is inaccessible.) 
	\item Make a fist with 1 hand and place it, pinkie down, on the outstretched palm of the other hand. Count ``One, Two, Three, Go.'' With each word (one, two, three), tap your fist against your palm.
	\item With the word ``Go,'' Change your hand to: a flat hand (to be palm to palm with the other) = paper, a sideways V made with index and middle finger = scissors, or keep your fist = rock.
	\item Compare your choice to your opponents choice. Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beat paper.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Stealth:} There is no stealth mechanic for combat in this game.

\section*{Health State and Death:} You cannot instigate combat to kill another character. \textbf{The most harm you can do is to knock someone out.} Pixies will find such violence excessive in all but the most dire of circumstances, and you will likely find yourself without the allies necessary to accomplish it without very good reason.

A knocked out character will wake up in 60 seconds. A restrained character will escape their restraints in 2 minutes, unless someone's full attention is on keeping them restrained.
